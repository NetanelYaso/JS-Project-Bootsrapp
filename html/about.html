    <p>
      The establishment of N-Y Company was driven by our ambition to maintain the growth trajectory of our commercial
      activities. <br> Although we already have considerable experience and know-how and the companies in the group have
      not
      yet exhausted their growth potential, we are nonetheless aware that we need finances to continue our development.
      <br>
      This is precisely the task with which FAIRDIP GROUP has been charged: to find investment capital for the group.

      Isaac Newton said that everything he achieved was the result of standing on the shoulders of giants. <br> I couldn’t
      put it any better. All of our success is down to your skills and untiring application. <br> Every day, I am amazed by
      the effort you put in and the sacrifices you make. <br> I just want you all to know how much I appreciate all your hard
      work.

    <p>
      It is a great honor for me to speak from this stage because I know that each of my colleagues and nominees was the
      same capable of winning the award.
      <br>
      I would like to thank the voters who decided that it is my time to stand here. I am also thankful to the award
      organizing committee because the contest encourages us to work hard and reach goals. After a year of working in
      our company, becoming the employee of the month is a valuable achievement for me.
      <br>
      I would never win the award without the constant support and an inspiring environment in my team. I am grateful to
      have colleagues who help me to deal with challenges. Moreover, I would like to thank our boss, Mr.Jones, who
      believed in me and gave me many chances to show my best during this month. It is a treasure to have a brilliant
      team and a great boss, and I am fortunate to have both in my work. Lastly, I am thankful to my family, who
      encouraged me to get the job at this company and have always been there for me.
      <br>
      Thank you very much!

    <p>
      We at N-Y Company are solely engaged in investment opportunities for which we can guarantee our partners and
      investors a sensible level of risk, but attractive appreciation in the value of investment. <br> Words such as
      “gamble”
      or “one-hundred-fold” are alien to us; we are conservative and focus only on those areas which we understand. <br>
      We
      primarily invest in the activities of related companies or in companies that we directly control. We work in areas
      that we understand and on markets that we know
